    <ul>
      <a><strong>Realization:</strong></a>
      <li>“Confucius had a great saying that every man has two lives, and the second starts when he realizes he has just one.”</li>
      <a><strong>Meaning:</strong></a>
      <li>"On the meaning of life: “There is no answer. The real answer is ‘because.’ You get to make up your own answer is the beauty. If there was a single answer, we would not be free. We would be trapped…we would all have to live to that answer…luckily there is no answer.”</li>
      <li>“Answers to all the great questions are paradoxes…How do I matter in this infinite universe? On the one hand, you’re separate…every two points are infinitely different…life is a single player game…on the other hand…you’re connected to everything, it’s inseparable.”</li>
      <li>“The answer to that question, ‘Do I matter?’ is ‘I am nothing, and I am everything’…all the great questions…all paradoxes…pursuing them is actually really useful because then it gives you certain intrinsic understanding in your life that brings a level of peace.”</li>
      <li>“You have to do hard things…to create your own meaning in life.”</li>
      <li>“The world just reflects your own feelings back at you. Reality is neutral.”</li>
      <a><strong>Authencity:</strong></a>
      <li>“What you want to get everyone to is retirement…Retirement is when you stop sacrificing today for some imaginary tomorrow. When today is complete, in and of itself, you’re retired.”</li>
        <li>“The way to get out of the competition trap is actually to be authentic. The way to retire is actually to find the thing that you know how to do better than anybody. And, you know how to do that better than anybody because you love to do it.”</li>
        <li>“When you’re actually trying to live your life in congruence with reality, you want to have a deep understanding of what you do and why you do it. So, it’s much more important to know the basics really well than to know the advanced.”</li>
        <li>“School, politics, sports, and games train us to compete against others. True rewards — wealth, knowledge, love, fitness, and equanimity — come from ignoring others and improving ourselves.”¹
 </li>
      <a><strong> Individuality:</strong></a>
        <li>“Most of modern life, all our diseases, are diseases of abundance, not diseases of scarcity.”</li>
        <li>“The way to survive in modern society is to be an ascetic. It is to retreat from society. There’s too much society everywhere you go…The only solution is turn it off.”</li>
        <li>“The ancient struggle used to be the tribal struggle…Modern life, we’re so free, everything has become atomized, we stand alone…The modern struggle as an individual is…drawing your own boundaries, and there’s no one there to help you.”</li>
        <li>Naval: “It’s easier to change yourself than to change the world.” Rogan: “And, the best way to change the world is to change yourself.” Naval: “Live the life you want other people to live.”</li>
        <li>“Life is really a single player game. It’s all going on in your head. Whatever you think, you believe, will very much shape your reality. Both from what risks you take and what actions you perform, but also just everyday experiences of reality.”</li>
        <li>“Doctors won’t make you healthy. Nutritionists won’t make you slim. Teachers won’t make you smart. Gurus won’t make you calm. Mentors won’t make you rich. Trainers won’t make you fit. Ultimately, you have to take responsibility. Save yourself.“¹</li>
